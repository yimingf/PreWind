                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Wind Mind focuses on exploiting wind energy more efficiently.<br>
                        We created a tool to help energy traders better predict future production volumes to more efficiently sell wind power to consumers.<br>
                        Our solution collects and transforms the complex data into actionable insights.<br>
                        Traders can follow wind farms and view the data gathered from them in the dashboard.<br>
                        The dashboard shows the historical data of production and weather as well as gives a tool to help create the prediction.<br>
                        Instead of presenting raw data the traders can view simple and holisticly formed visualizations, which support their decision making processes.<br>

            <h4>UX Designer</h4>
            <p style="font: bold;">Contribution</p>
          <p>I was not familiar with how the wind power and wind power markets works. Who is wind power trader and how they are working and what difficulties they are dealing with.
              Therefore, I did some research and literature review to understand the data (wind specifications) and how wind power markets work.
              It took 14 hours (one week, 2hrs per day) for me to understand initial concept, but still a lot of confusions were existed.
              We have met Sebastian to ask some questions about the data.
              Afterward, I decided to focus on the data which Sebastian gave us and explore the available data and the required one.
              The data was so vague for us. Based on the research, I figured out wind power specifications, what pattern is required.
              Understanding the concept was very important to me as a designer.<p>
            <p>
              Deepika and I designed some mok ups and finalized one of them (it took almost 8 days) and sent it to Sebastian.
              We received some feedback and to have a better understanding of what is their idea about the initial design, we met Sebastian again.
              I participated in all the meetings (average twice per week) and I was active in group communications (slack).
              The group was big and communication was hard but I learned how to manage the communication in such a group.
              I contacted our client as well.</p>
            <p>
              I was not familiar with the principle of data visualization.
              I studied which figures and color suits our project.
              I searched in different libraries like (D3, plotly) to find appropriate design structure.
              I contributed in ‘production dashboard’ for hello world.
              After, we started to work on different modules and gathering data and information.</p>

             <p> In coding the design, I added some small thing like json file for wind farms’ information and pictures.
              I made the GIF to show the wind turbine to be used in the map as wind turbine farms indicator. I learned how to use GitHub in group.
                I made and presented the final presentation. I also made the initial script for video. Deepika and I made the C-award video (the animations).</p>

          <!-- Your Contribution -->
            <p>I have no specific role since I have done all form of work during the project:-) My journey begin with contact our clients for meeting and through out the project I handled the communication with them.</p>
            <p>Then I did some user research and data analysis, during which I read some papers about wind production and its trading. I had a difficult time in getting the overview of the project. We had to meet our clients thrice before hello world and also exchanged some mails to get more insights</p>
            <p>Me and Rana(One of the other team member) took almost a week to understand data and simultaneously designed some prototypes. During this process, I was always in touch with our clients to get immediate feedback.</p>
            <p>For the final project, The prediction part of the dashboard is entirely developed by me. Since I was really new to the programming, I took some time to complete but I did. During this process, I learned angularjs and plotly(D3 library) I also learnt to use github.</p>
            <p> Finally, I did a small contribution in the video editing also.</p>
            <p>Beside technical part, I would say the most important part what I learned is team management. I never worked in such a big team. Due the vague concept, the entire team had a difficult time to maintain the spirit but this is life, you got to learn and work and we made it:-)</p>
            <p> I would like to thank and congratulate the entire team for their contribution.</p>

                <h2>Meri Terho</h2>
                <h4>UX Design/FrontEnd</h4>
                <p>Contribution</p>
                <p>I participated in the front-end and design work during the project as well as took initiative in project management related tasks. My focus throughout the project was in storytelling and communicating the users needs as well as we could. I learned extremely much about collaboration within a diverse group of people and how to efficiently communicate with people from different cultures.
                    In the beginning of the project I focused on research and understanding the complex needs and demands of the energy traders operating in the hectic energy market. I was responsible for constructing and fine-tuning our project proposal. After this I participated in the design work and ideation of the Hello World Demo. From the Hello World Demo we got comments to focus on the storytelling and I took responsibility of focusing on this. I focused in linking our work into the real world by finding wind farms in the Nordic to view in our project.
                    In the weeks of our project work I took initiative and worked with our team to create the best possible visualization we could. I was also responsible for finding and cleaning the needed weather data for our visualization.  During the final weeks I also started to work more and more hands on with the code by doing small design and front-end changes to the code. Also during the final week Yinan and I worked on our website.
                    After the final presentation I took the responsibility of creating the video for C-awards. Rana and Deepika created a initial proposal for the script and animations, which worked as a good start for the actual production of the film. Adjusting the script, recording the voice-over, finding suitable creative commons video clips and editing the video took me in total around 20 hours in total.
                </p>
                <p>Lessons Learned:</p>
                <p>Finding new libraries to help work flow.
                    Cleaning data and structuring it to visualizations
                    Working in a truly diverse team. Tools for collaboration: Slack, Github</p>
